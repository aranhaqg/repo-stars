# README

A Rails API that keeps track of the stars that a given user has in its Github repositories.
This application must have an endpoint that receives a Github username and in the background searches the user's public repositories using Github's REST API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api) and saves in a database their repository name and how many stars it has.
You must use Sidekiq and we expect some tests using RSpec.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
